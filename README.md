# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple, interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum and demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

## 🎮 Features

- **Play Against the Computer**: Click a button to choose rock, paper, or scissors; the computer picks randomly.
- **Live Score Tracking**: The game displays and updates your score and the computer's score after each round.
- **Result Display**: See the outcome of each round and the overall winner when someone reaches 5 points.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface with styled buttons and result display.
