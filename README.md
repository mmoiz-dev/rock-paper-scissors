# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript, HTML, and the browser's prompt/console. This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum and demonstrates basic JavaScript logic, user input, and DOM interaction.

## 🎮 Features

- **Play Against the Computer**: The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors each round.
- **User Input**: Enter your choice via a browser prompt.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of both the player's and computer's scores.
- **Five Rounds**: The game is played over five rounds, with the winner announced at the end.
- **Console Output**: All results and scores are displayed in the browser console.
